# 🎲 Random Quotes App (Next.js + Context API)

This is a **learning project** built with Next.js (App Router).  
It demonstrates the core React concepts:

- ✅ Components
- ✅ Props
- ✅ State
- ✅ Events
- ✅ Context API

---

## 🚀 Features
- Shows random quotes with author name
- **Like button** → increases like count for the current quote
- **Next button** → goes to the next quote
- Prevents liking the same quote twice (disabled after click)
- Shared state via **Context API** (`QuotesContext` + `QuotesProvider`)
